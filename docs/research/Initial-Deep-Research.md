Great. I’ll create a full implementation blueprint for a project called **HealthCare-GPT** that fine-tunes a lightweight GPT model (like nanoGPT) locally in Docker, uses OpenWebText pretraining as a base, supports high-risk patient classification, and can ingest `.csv`, `.md`, and `.txt` research content for interactive understanding.

This will include:

* Complete directory structure
* Pseudocode and module explanations
* Sample input formats
* Docker + Python setup
* Minimal requirements to run on a home PC (8–16 GB RAM, consumer GPU if available)

I’ll let you know when it’s ready for review.


# HealthCare-GPT Implementation Plan

## Project Overview and Goals

**HealthCare-GPT** is a local-run project that fine-tunes a nanoGPT-like transformer model for healthcare tasks. It builds on a GPT-2 style model pre-trained on OpenWebText (for general language ability) and adapts it to domain-specific data. The key goals include:

* **High-Risk Patient Classification:** Given patient data in a tabular CSV format, the model should identify or classify high-risk cases (e.g. predict a "high risk" flag based on the features).
* **Research Document Ingestion:** Incorporate medical research knowledge from provided `.md` and `.txt` files so the model is aware of domain concepts and can use this in its outputs.
* **Interactive Generation/Summarization:** Enable a lightweight interactive mode where a user can input patient information or research text and receive generated outputs (e.g. risk assessment or a summary) from the model.
* **Local Hardware Deployment:** All training and inference runs on a standard PC (8–16 GB RAM, with optional GPU acceleration). The solution must be resource-conscious and easy to deploy (including via Docker) for users without specialized infrastructure.

**Approach in brief:** We will adapt Andrej Karpathy’s **nanoGPT** codebase for our model architecture and training loop. A base GPT-2 small (≈124M parameters) pretrained on OpenWebText will serve as the foundation. We then fine-tune this model on domain-specific data: first on unstructured medical text (to instill domain knowledge), and then on structured patient examples formatted as text (to learn the classification task). The project will be organized with clarity and modularity in mind, using distinct folders for data, model code, training scripts, and results. We also provide a Docker configuration for reproducible deployment. The overall design emphasizes maintainability (clear code, config files, documentation) and simplicity, so junior ML engineers or researchers can easily use and extend the project.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into a base directory **`HealthCare-GPT/`** with clear subdirectories for code, data, models, and configuration. Below is the complete folder and file structure, along with brief descriptions of each component:

```

Each folder is explicitly separated for clarity. For instance, **`nanoGPT/`** contains the core model and training logic (based on Karpathy’s implementation), while **`scripts/`** contains user-facing scripts that utilize those components. The **`HealthCareData/`** folder holds the input datasets: patient CSVs and research text files are kept in separate subfolders, making it easy to locate data sources. Processed data (like combined text or tokenized binaries) can be stored in `processed/` to speed up repeated runs. The **`models/`** directory cleanly distinguishes the base pretrained model from our fine-tuned model checkpoints. Configurations are stored in a central **`config/`** so that hyperparameters and paths can be adjusted without touching code. A top-level **`README.md`** provides instructions for newcomers on how to set up and run the project. This organized structure makes the project maintainable and easy to navigate for junior engineers.

## Setup and Requirements

We aim to minimize dependencies to ensure the project runs on limited resources. The following are the key requirements (with recommended versions) needed to run HealthCare-GPT locally:

* **Python 3.9+** – Programming language for the project (the code is written in Python).
* **PyTorch 2.x** – Deep learning framework used for model training and inference (provides GPU acceleration if available). We use PyTorch as the backend for the nanoGPT model.
* **Numpy 1.x** – NumPy for numerical operations, data manipulation and to support PyTorch tensors where needed.
* **Pandas 1.x** – Used in preprocessing to easily load and manipulate CSV tabular data (for patient records).
* **Huggingface Transformers 4.x** – (Optional) Used to load GPT-2 pretrained weights and tokenizer. The nanoGPT code can integrate with Transformers to initialize from GPT-2 checkpoints.
* **Huggingface Datasets 2.x** – (Optional) Used to download or stream the OpenWebText dataset for pretraining (if we choose to do so via their API).
* **tiktoken** – OpenAI’s BPE tokenizer library for tokenizing text (fast byte-pair encoding, useful if not using Huggingface tokenizers).
* **tqdm** – For progress bars during training (for user-friendly logging of training epochs/iterations).
* **wandb** – (Optional) Weights & Biases for experiment logging (included in Karpathy’s repo for logging; can be skipped or turned off to keep things simple).
* **Flask or Gradio** – (Optional, choose one if using `serve.py`) Lightweight web frameworks for serving the model in interactive mode. **Flask** can be used to create a simple REST API, whereas **Gradio** provides an easy web UI for entering text or uploading files to get model predictions. These are only needed if you plan to deploy the interactive server interface.
* **PyYAML** – For parsing configuration files (if using `.yaml` config files to set hyperparameters and file paths).

All these dependencies (minus Python itself) are listed in `requirements.txt` with pinned versions for reproducibility. By freezing specific versions, we ensure that everyone uses the same library versions, avoiding unexpected bugs. The environment is deliberately kept minimal. Notably, we use **GPT-2 small** (124M parameters) as our base model, which is feasible to run on a machine with 8GB RAM (16GB is recommended for smoother training). If a GPU with \~4GB or more VRAM is available, training speed will improve significantly, but the code is also runnable on CPU (albeit much slower).

## Training and Inference Workflow Overview

This section gives a high-level overview of how data flows through the training and inference pipeline of HealthCare-GPT:

1. **Data Ingestion:** We collect patient data and research documents. Patient data in CSV format is read and converted into a textual format (so it can be fed into the GPT model). Research papers or notes in Markdown/Text are also gathered as additional training text.
2. **Preprocessing:** Using `scripts/preprocess.py`, we transform the raw data into a model-ready format. For CSVs, each patient record (row) is turned into a descriptive text + label. For example, a row of medical measurements might be converted to a sentence or structured prompt like:
   *"Patient: Age=65, BloodPressure=180/110, Diabetes=Yes, Cholesterol=High. **Risk:** HighRisk"*
   These text lines (with the expected output embedded) will teach the model to predict "HighRisk" given the patient info. The research documents are cleaned (unnecessary formatting removed) and possibly concatenated or segmented into chunks of plain text.
3. **Model Initialization:** We initialize the nanoGPT model (in `nanoGPT/model.py`) using a GPT-2 architecture suitable for our hardware. For example, we might use 12 transformer layers, 12 attention heads, 768-dimensional embeddings (GPT-2 small configuration). We load pretrained weights from OpenWebText/GPT-2 to accelerate training (so the model doesn't learn English from scratch). The tokenizer (BPE) is also prepared to encode/decode text.
4. **Fine-Tuning Training:** Using `scripts/finetune.py` (which calls functions in `nanoGPT/train.py`), we fine-tune the model on our domain data. This can be a multi-stage process:

   * *Domain adaptation:* First, continue training the model on the collected medical text (research\_docs and any textual data extracted from patient records) using the language modeling objective (predict next token). This helps the model familiarize itself with medical terminology and context.
   * *Supervised task training:* Next, train the model to perform the high-risk classification task. We use the formatted patient texts with labels. The training loop treats this as a language modeling task as well: the model learns to output the correct label word (e.g., "HighRisk" or "LowRisk") at the end of each patient record description. We ensure the label token is included in the vocabulary. We may also insert a special separator or prompt like `"Risk:"` to clearly demarcate where the model should output the classification.
     Training runs for a certain number of epochs over the prepared dataset. We monitor the loss (and accuracy on a validation split of data) to avoid overfitting. The training process is designed to be done on a single machine; with a smaller model and careful batch sizing, it will fit in 8–16GB RAM. (If using a GPU, operations can be in FP16 to save memory.)
5. **Checkpointing:** Model weights are periodically saved to `models/finetuned/` (e.g., every epoch or at the end) so that training can be resumed or the best model can be retrieved. The final fine-tuned model (after training) is saved as `healthcare_gpt.pt` (or a similar name) which will be used for inference.
6. **Interactive Inference:** For generation and summarization tasks, we load the fine-tuned model in `scripts/inference.py`. Depending on user input, the inference process will:

   * If given a *patient's data* (either as a single row or a small CSV), format it as a prompt in the same way as training (e.g., `"Patient: ... Risk:"`) and let the model predict the risk label or even a short explanation. The output might be simply "HighRisk" or "LowRisk", or we can prompt the model to elaborate (since it's a language model, we could ask it to generate a sentence assessing the risk).
   * If given a *research text or question*, the model can be prompted to summarize it or answer questions about it. For example, we might prepend `"Summarize the following:\n"` to the research document text and then generate a summary. Since our model has been exposed to medical text, it should be able to produce a coherent summary or at least highlight key points.
     The inference script can run in a loop (for CLI interaction) or serve one-off queries (especially if backing an API). It will tokenize the input, run it through the model to generate output tokens, and then decode the result for the user.
7. **Evaluation (Optional):** We can use `scripts/evaluate.py` to measure the model's performance. For classification, we can compute accuracy or F1 by comparing model outputs on a test CSV to the true labels. For generation tasks like summarization, evaluation is more qualitative, but we can at least ensure the summary length is reasonable and key facts are present.

Throughout this process, **maintainability and reproducibility** are kept in mind. The config files in `config/` can be used to record hyperparameters (like learning rate, number of epochs, context length, batch size, etc.) and these can be version-controlled or shared. The training can be made deterministic by setting random seeds (for PyTorch, NumPy) at the start of `train.py`, so that results can be reproduced. Each step is also documented in the code and in the README for clarity.

## Data Preparation Module (`preprocess.py`)

The **preprocessing module** is responsible for converting raw data (CSV and text) into the format needed for training the transformer. This is typically run offline before training. Key functions and pseudocode for this module include:

* **Loading Patient CSV Data:** Using pandas, we load patient records from files in `HealthCareData/patient_data/`. We assume each record has various features (age, lab results, conditions, etc.) and an associated risk label. For example, a row might look like:
  `{PatientID: 123, Age: 70, BloodPressure: "180/110", Diabetes: 1, Cholesterol: "High", HighRiskFlag: 1}`.
  In `preprocess.py`, we load the DataFrame and iterate over each row to construct a textual representation:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv("HealthCareData/patient_data/patients.csv")
  text_samples = []
  for _, row in df.iterrows():
      # Construct a textual description of the patient
      desc = (f"Patient: Age {row['Age']}, BloodPressure {row['BloodPressure']}, "
              f"Diabetes {'Yes' if row['Diabetes']==1 else 'No'}, Cholesterol {row['Cholesterol']}.")
      # Append the label as a target output
      label = "HighRisk" if row["HighRiskFlag"] == 1 else "LowRisk"
      sample = desc + " Risk: " + label  # e.g., "Patient: ... Risk: HighRisk"
      text_samples.append(sample)
  # Now text_samples is a list of strings, each representing one labeled example.
  ```

  We ensure that the wording and format ("Risk: ...") matches what we'll use in training/inference prompts. All patient samples might be concatenated into one large training text or written line-by-line to a file. We also split into training/validation sets (e.g., 90% train, 10% val) so we can evaluate during training. For example, the module might output `train_data.txt` and `val_data.txt` in `HealthCareData/processed/`.

* **Processing Research Documents:** We load each `.md` or `.txt` file from `HealthCareData/research_docs/`. We strip out any non-text markup (for Markdown files, remove headers, links, etc., unless they contain important content). We then either combine all documents into one large text file or keep them separate and intermix during training. For simplicity, we can concatenate them with separating tokens or newlines. For example:

  ```python
  import glob
  research_files = glob.glob("HealthCareData/research_docs/*.*")
  research_text = ""
  for file_path in research_files:
      with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
          content = f.read()
          # (Optional) process markdown formatting if needed
          content = content.replace('\n', ' ')  # simple way to handle newlines for now
          research_text += content + "\n\n"
  ```

  The `research_text` could then be appended to the training data as additional unlabeled text. If the research docs contain multiple topics, it might be wise to split them into paragraphs or reasonable chunks before feeding to the model (to avoid overly long sequences that exceed the model context length).

* **Tokenization and Encoding:** Once we have our text data prepared, we may tokenize it using the GPT-2 tokenizer (BPE). This can be done on-the-fly in the training loop, or we can pre-tokenize and save binary files for faster loading (as Karpathy’s nanoGPT does). For maintainability, doing it on the fly using libraries is simplest:

  ```python
  from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast
  tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")  # load GPT-2's tokenizer
  train_tokens = tokenizer(train_text, return_tensors='pt').input_ids  # example for entire text
  ```

  But feeding an entire text at once is memory-heavy; instead, we can save `train_data.txt` and use a streaming approach in training. The **nanoGPT `data_loader.py`** (if implemented) could read `train_data.txt` and chunk it into sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 256 or 512 tokens) for each training example. We will set the model’s `max_context_length` in config (say 512 tokens) accordingly.

* **Output:** The preprocess script ultimately produces training and validation data ready for the model. This could be in the form of text files or binary token files (e.g., Karpathy’s `train.bin`, `val.bin` format containing token IDs). We favor clarity: generating plain text sequences that the training loop can tokenize as needed. The script logs summary stats (like how many samples generated, vocabulary info if applicable) to help verify everything is correct. By separating this preprocessing step, we ensure the training code can remain focused on modeling, and different datasets can be plugged in by just rerunning `preprocess.py`.

*Maintainability note:* This module is kept simple and well-documented so it’s easy to adjust the formatting or incorporate new data. For instance, if the schema of the patient CSV changes or if new text data is added, the script can be updated accordingly. By outputting standardized text files, we also make it easier to inspect the training data (a junior engineer can open `train_data.txt` to see exactly what the model will train on).

## Model Training Module (`train.py` and `finetune.py`)

The training component fine-tunes the GPT model on our prepared dataset. We leverage the existing **`nanoGPT/train.py`** for the core training logic, customizing it via configuration or minimal code changes for our specific tasks. The training is designed to be done on a single machine with optional GPU. Here’s how the module is structured and operates:

* **Configuration:** The `config/config.yaml` file contains hyperparameters such as model size, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. For example:

  ```yaml
  model:
    n_layers: 12
    n_heads: 12
    d_emb: 768        # embedding dimension
    context_length: 512
  train:
    batch_size: 8
    epochs: 5
    learning_rate: 3e-5
    device: "cuda"    # or "cpu"
    grad_accumulation: 2   # accumulate gradients if memory is low
    train_data_path: "HealthCareData/processed/train_data.txt"
    val_data_path: "HealthCareData/processed/val_data.txt"
    out_dir: "models/finetuned"
  ```

  The `finetune.py` script will read this config (using PyYAML) and pass the parameters into the training routine. This separation means we can easily tweak settings (for example, reduce batch\_size if running on 8GB RAM, or adjust learning\_rate).

* **Model Initialization:** In `nanoGPT/model.py`, we define the GPT model class. This likely mirrors Karpathy’s implementation: an embedding layer, a stack of Transformer decoder blocks, and a final linear layer to predict the next token. Before training starts, we instantiate this model. If a `pretrained` checkpoint is provided, we load those weights:

  ```python
  model = GPT(config.model)  # create model with desired dimensions
  if pretrained_ckpt_path:
      model.load_state_dict(torch.load(pretrained_ckpt_path))
  ```

  Here, `pretrained_ckpt_path` might point to `models/pretrained/gpt2_openwebtext.ckpt`. For example, we could use Hugging Face to download GPT-2 small’s weights and convert them if necessary (Karpathy’s code can directly load GPT-2 weights via the Transformers library). Starting from pretrained weights gives the model a head-start and means fewer epochs are required to converge on our tasks.

* **Training Loop:** The training loop is implemented in `nanoGPT/train.py`. We adapt it to our dataset as follows:

  * **Data Loading:** We open `train_data.txt` and `val_data.txt`. If using the nanoGPT style, we might load the entire text and convert to a stream of token IDs. Then we create a PyTorch `Dataset` that yields chunks of length `context_length` from this stream. Another approach is to treat each line (each patient sample or text chunk) as an independent training sample. Either is viable; chunking a continuous stream works well for language modeling. For classification examples, since each line is a self-contained sample ending with the label, treating each line as its own sequence can also work (with padding/truncation to fit context length). We ensure the data loader shuffles the sequences each epoch for stochasticity.
  * **Optimization Setup:** We use an optimizer like AdamW with a small learning rate (since we are fine-tuning). We may also employ learning rate warm-up and cosine decay (common in training transformers) – Karpathy’s config supports these. We also decide on a loss function; since it’s language modeling, the standard is cross-entropy on the next-token prediction. For our mixed data (text and "Risk:" label), the same next-token loss inherently trains the model to predict the correct label token when it reaches the end of a patient description.
  * **Forward Pass:** For each batch of token sequences, we do:

    ```python
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    input_ids = batch[:, :-1]      # all tokens except last (as inputs)
    targets = batch[:, 1:]         # all tokens except first (as targets shifted by one)
    outputs = model(input_ids)     # forward pass (get logits for each position)
    loss = cross_entropy(outputs.view(-1, vocab_size), targets.view(-1))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    ```

    This is a typical language modeling training step. In our scenario, sequences include patient descriptions followed by "Risk: HighRisk/LowRisk". The model will learn to predict the correct label word at the position after "Risk:". We monitor this loss; we can also calculate **accuracy on the risk token** by checking if the model’s highest-probability prediction at that position matches the true label. We might print or log this to see classification performance on the fly.
  * **Gradient Accumulation:** Because we are on limited hardware, if the effective batch size needs to be larger than what memory allows, we accumulate gradients. For instance, with `grad_accumulation: 2` in config and a physical batch size of 4, the code will iterate two batches, sum up gradients, then perform an optimizer step, effectively acting like batch size 8 without needing to hold 8 at once in memory.
  * **Validation:** Every certain number of iterations or at epoch end, we run the model on `val_data.txt` (or a set of validation samples) without gradient to compute loss/accuracy. This helps ensure the model is learning and to detect overfitting. If the validation loss starts increasing, we may stop early.
  * **Checkpoint Saving:** We save model checkpoints to `models/finetuned/` (the directory is specified by `out_dir`). Typically, we save the final model and maybe intermediate ones. For simplicity, we might save only the final model (after all epochs) as `healthcare_gpt.pt`. If training is long, one could save every epoch or use the lowest validation loss model. The script prints out that the model was saved, so the user knows training produced a model file.

* **Multi-Stage Training Consideration:** If doing a two-phase training (unsupervised on text then supervised on CSV), we can implement that in `finetune.py` by running the trainer twice. For example:

  ```python
  # Stage 1: Language model adaptation on research text
  config.train.train_data_path = "HealthCareData/processed/research_only.txt"
  config.train.epochs = 1
  train_model(config)
  # load weights from stage 1 and proceed to stage 2
  config.train.train_data_path = "HealthCareData/processed/train_data.txt"
  config.train.epochs = 3
  train_model(config, resume_from= "models/finetuned/checkpoint_stage1.pt")
  ```

  This way, the first stage improves the model’s domain knowledge, and the second stage focuses on the specific task. However, for simplicity and given limited data, one could also merge the datasets and do a single-stage training by mixing in the research text with the patient data. The training code would then essentially perform multi-task learning (predicting both normal next words for research text and the "Risk" labels for patient entries). This might require careful ordering or sampling (perhaps ensure each epoch sees a balanced mix). The approach can be adjusted based on results and available data.

* **Resource Management:** We set the training to use GPU if `device` is "cuda" and if a CUDA-enabled GPU is present. Otherwise, it defaults to CPU. On CPU, we might reduce model size or sequence length to keep things reasonable. We also utilize PyTorch’s built-in features for efficiency: e.g., `torch.cuda.amp.autocast` for mixed precision if on GPU (to reduce memory usage), or `pin_memory=True` in DataLoader for faster host-to-GPU transfers. Given the model is not extremely large and data sizes are modest, the training should be doable on a single GPU within a few hours (depending on epochs), or on CPU within perhaps a day for a small epoch count. We'll note these expectations in the README for users.

* **Logging:** The training script will output progress to console (and optionally to W\&B if configured). For instance, each iteration or each N% of an epoch, print the current loss. This gives feedback to the user that the model is improving. Because we have specific interest in classification accuracy, we might add a special log: whenever a "Risk:" token is the target, check if the model’s predicted token was correct, and accumulate stats. This can be done by decoding or by having a label token ID and seeing if the argmax equals that ID. This is a small addition to monitor task performance.

In summary, the training module fine-tunes the transformer with careful attention to hardware constraints (small batch sizes, checkpointing, optional half precision). It results in a model ready to perform our healthcare tasks. The code is kept modular (separating data loading, model definition, training loop logic), making it easier to maintain or adapt. A junior engineer can read through `train.py` (which in nanoGPT is \~300 lines of clear code) and understand how the training is proceeding.

## Inference Module (`inference.py` and `serve.py`)

After training, we use the fine-tuned model to perform interactive inference – either through a command-line interface or a simple web service. The inference module loads the trained model and processes inputs (patient data or text) to generate the desired output. There are a few modes to consider:

* **Batch Classification (from CSV):** A user might want to classify multiple patients in a CSV. In this case, `inference.py` can accept a path to a CSV file. The pseudocode for handling this:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  from nanoGPT.model import GPT

  # Load model checkpoint
  model = GPT(config.model)
  model.load_state_dict(torch.load("models/finetuned/healthcare_gpt.pt"))
  model.eval()  # set to evaluation mode (no dropout, etc.)

  # Load and iterate through CSV
  df = pd.read_csv(user_provided_csv_path)
  for _, row in df.iterrows():
      prompt = format_patient_row_to_text(row)  # similar to how we did in training
      output = generate_text(prompt)
      print(f"Input: {prompt}\nModel Output: {output}\n")
  ```

  Here, `format_patient_row_to_text` would create the "Patient: ... Risk:" string. The `generate_text(prompt)` function encodes the prompt and uses the model to predict the next token(s). For classification, we actually only need the single token after "Risk:" (or the single word output). We can constrain generation to a few tokens or until a newline. For example, using greedy decoding:

  ```python
  tokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)
  tokens = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long).unsqueeze(0)  # batch of size 1
  with torch.no_grad():
      output_logits = model(tokens)
  # Get the last logit (for the next token prediction)
  next_token_logits = output_logits[0, -1, :]
  predicted_id = int(torch.argmax(next_token_logits))
  predicted_token = tokenizer.decode([predicted_id])
  ```

  This gives us the predicted label ("HighRisk" or "LowRisk"). We can print or save this result. If the CSV has an ID column, we might output a CSV or text report mapping each patient ID to the predicted risk. This batch mode is useful for evaluating many records at once.

* **Interactive Prompt (single query):** The script can also accept a user-typed prompt. If run without a file, `inference.py` could drop into an interactive loop:

  ```python
  while True:
      user_input = input("Enter patient data or text (or 'quit'): ")
      if user_input.strip().lower() in ('q','quit'):
          break
      # Detect if it's a CSV line or a free-form text
      if looks_like_csv(user_input):
          prompt = convert_csv_line_to_prompt(user_input)
      else:
          prompt = user_input
      output = generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=100)  # allow more tokens for free-form text
      print("Model:", output)
  ```

  Here, `looks_like_csv` could be a simple heuristic or flag. More straightforwardly, we might require the user to preface input with a mode (e.g., start with "PATIENT:" vs "TEXT:"). In any case, for a patient input we ensure "Risk:" is at the end of the prompt to force a classification output. For a free-form text input (like asking a question or giving a paragraph), we generate a longer output. The `generate_text` function for summarization or Q\&A would use the model to generate multiple tokens until an end condition. We might use a decoding strategy (greedy or top-k sampling) depending on whether we want deterministic or varied output. Summaries should be concise, so we could limit `max_tokens` or stop when a newline is generated.

* **Summarization of Research Docs:** If the user provides a large text (like a research paper content), directly feeding it might exceed the model’s context length if very long. In practice, for lengthy documents, we might chunk the text (e.g., summarize each section then summarize the summaries). However, given our context size (512 tokens), if the document is within that size it can be summarized in one go. For example:

  ```python
  text = open("HealthCareData/research_docs/guidelines.txt").read()
  prompt = "Summarize the following medical document:\n" + text[:1000]  # taking first 1000 characters for safety
  summary = generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=150)
  print("Summary:\n", summary)
  ```

  This would produce a summary. The model’s ability to do this depends on it having learned summarization-like behavior. We did not explicitly fine-tune on summary pairs, but language models often can produce a reasonable attempt if prompted clearly. If higher quality summaries are needed, one could fine-tune on known summaries or implement a more complex retrieval+generation pipeline. For now, a straightforward prompt-based approach is taken for simplicity.

* **`serve.py` – Web API (optional):** For a more user-friendly deployment, we provide `serve.py` which sets up a minimal web server. For example, using Flask:

  ```python
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  app = Flask(__name__)
  # Load model globally
  model = GPT(config.model); model.load_state_dict(torch.load("models/finetuned/healthcare_gpt.pt")); model.eval()
  tokenizer = ... # load tokenizer similarly

  @app.route('/infer', methods=['POST'])
  def infer():
      data = request.json
      if "patient" in data:
          # Expecting patient data as dict or string
          prompt = format_patient_data(data["patient"])
      elif "text" in data:
          prompt = data["text"] if data["text"].strip().endswith(":") else data["text"] + "\nSummary:"
      else:
          return jsonify({"error": "No input provided"}), 400
      output = generate_text(prompt)  # similar to above, generate using model
      return jsonify({"output": output})

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
  ```

  This would allow a user to POST a JSON like `{"patient": {"Age": 70, "BloodPressure": "180/110", ...}}` or `{"text": "Some research paragraph..."}` and get a result. Alternatively, using **Gradio** to create a small web UI is even simpler:

  ```python
  import gradio as gr
  def classify_or_summarize(input_text):
      # logic to detect and generate output (same as above)
      return output_text
  iface = gr.Interface(fn=classify_or_summarize, inputs="textbox", outputs="textbox", title="HealthCare-GPT")
  iface.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", server_port=5000)
  ```

  Gradio automatically creates a nice textbox UI for input and output, which is great for demonstration purposes. This `serve.py` is optional, but it provides a blueprint for how one could deploy the model as a service. In either case, **port 5000** is used (and exposed in Docker) so that the interface can be accessed via a browser or API calls on localhost.

* **Memory/Performance Considerations:** During inference on CPU, generation can be slow if the model is large. To keep it lightweight, we use a small model size and can also enable torch’s half-precision or int8 quantization for the model weights when loading for inference (this would reduce memory and potentially speed up CPU inference). If using a GPU, the GPU memory (VRAM) will be used for the model – a 124M model uses only a couple hundred MB of VRAM, which is fine for even a 4GB GPU. Batch inference on multiple patients is also possible if needed (since classification is just one token generation, the model can handle a batch of prompts in parallel if coded accordingly).

The inference code is written clearly and with comments, so junior engineers can follow what is happening. It avoids overly complex techniques – for example, using greedy decoding for deterministic output, which is easier to understand than nucleus sampling. The focus is on reliability and clarity, so the user can trust the outputs and modify the interface or prompts as needed for their purposes.

## Docker Deployment and Runtime Tips

To ensure the project runs consistently on any machine, we include a Docker setup. The **Dockerfile** encapsulates the environment setup, installing all requirements and setting up the entry point for either training or serving. Here’s what the Dockerfile might look like and important considerations:

```Dockerfile
# Base image with Python (use slim for minimal size; can use CUDA base if GPU support is needed)
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Ensuring no cache to reduce image size and layering
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Install system packages if needed (e.g., git if using Huggingface datasets, others)
# In many cases, none or only minimal ones are required since we're mostly pip installing.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirement file and install deps
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the project code to the container
COPY . /app

# Expose port 5000 for the server (if we use serve.py)
EXPOSE 5000

# The default command can run the web server; for other uses, it can be overridden at runtime.
CMD ["python", "scripts/serve.py"]
```

**Build and Run:** A user can build the image with:

```
docker build -t healthcare-gpt .
```

This will install all Python dependencies inside the container. The image is based on a slim Python image to keep it lightweight. We install git because Huggingface `datasets` might need it to download certain files (depending on how OpenWebText is fetched). If GPU support is desired, the user should base off an NVIDIA CUDA image. For example, using `FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu20.04` and then installing Python and requirements, or simply using the PyTorch provided images (like `pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime`). In that case, one should also ensure the Docker run uses `--gpus all` and that NVIDIA Docker is configured on the host.

To run the container for the interactive server, one would do:

```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name hc_gpt_container healthcare-gpt
```

This starts the container detached and maps container port 5000 to localhost:5000. After that, the user can open a browser to `http://localhost:5000` (if using Gradio UI) or send POST requests (if using Flask API) to get model outputs. We recommend allocating sufficient memory to the container if using Docker on Windows/Mac (e.g., ensure Docker’s memory setting is at least 8GB). The model itself is not huge, but training inside a container might require more memory for safety (if one plans to train in Docker, consider 12-16GB allocation).

If the user instead wants to run training inside Docker (not just inference), they can override the CMD:

```
docker run -it -v /path/to/local/data:/app/HealthCareData healthcare-gpt python scripts/finetune.py --config config/config.yaml
```

Here we also show mounting a volume for data, so that large data files (like the OpenWebText or patient CSVs) don’t have to be baked into the image. This helps with reproducibility – you can keep data separate and just mount it when running the container.

**Image Size and Optimization:** Using the slim base and `--no-cache-dir` helps keep the image size lower. We only copy what’s needed into the image. If we wanted to slim further, we could use a multi-stage build (e.g., build any wheels in an intermediate container then copy only runtime artifacts). However, since our dependencies are mostly pure Python or have pre-built wheels, the image should remain reasonably small (order of a few hundred MB, mostly due to PyTorch). We don’t include any large data in the image. The model checkpoint (which might be a few hundred MB for 124M parameters in FP32) can be included in the image under `models/finetuned/` if desired, or downloaded at runtime. Including it makes the container self-contained for inference at the cost of a larger image.

**Runtime Tips:** Running on local hardware means being mindful of memory:

* If you face out-of-memory errors during training, reduce the batch size in `config.yaml` or use gradient accumulation. Also ensure no other heavy programs are eating RAM. On a 8GB RAM machine, it’s wise to use a smaller context (maybe 256 tokens) and fewer layers (perhaps 6-8 layers) if needed to fit memory. Our default GPT-2 small may push 8GB RAM during training, but with optimizations it can work; otherwise drop model size slightly.
* The training script can also be configured to periodically dump memory usage stats (using `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` if on GPU) to help debug any memory leaks.
* For inference, if the model is too slow on CPU, consider using a smaller model or enabling quantization. One could use e.g. `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, dtype=torch.qint8)` to reduce the model size in memory at some loss of accuracy. Because we prioritize simplicity, we did not integrate quantization into the main pipeline, but it's a tip for advanced users.

Finally, to maintain reproducibility, one can also use Docker to freeze the state: by sharing the image with colleagues, everyone runs the same software versions. The random seeds can be fixed so that model training yields the same results across runs (given the same environment). The entire setup (from preprocessing to training to inference) can thus be executed inside the container for consistency. Documentation in the README will guide users through these Docker usage scenarios.

## Maintainability and Reproducibility Considerations

In designing HealthCare-GPT, we have emphasized clean organization and simple, well-documented code to make it accessible to junior engineers and researchers. Here are some final notes on maintainability and reproducibility:

* **Clear Module Separation:** The directory structure separates concerns (data vs model vs scripts vs configs), so one can modify parts of the project in isolation. For instance, changing how data is formatted doesn’t require touching model code – just edit `preprocess.py`. This modularity makes maintenance easier as the project grows.
* **Documentation and Examples:** The `README.md` includes step-by-step instructions for setup, training, and inference. It also lists example commands (including Docker commands) to run each stage. By providing examples, new users can quickly try out the model with minimal confusion.
* **Configuration-Driven:** Almost all tunable settings are in the `config/` files. This reduces the chance of bugs from hard-coded values and makes experiments reproducible. If someone finds a better hyperparameter setting, they can create a new config file rather than altering code. We also include default configs for common scenarios (like a smaller model config for quick tests).
* **Reproducible Training:** We set random seeds in the training script (for PyTorch, NumPy, etc.) so that runs are deterministic (at least on the same hardware). This means if two people run the training with the same data and config, they should get very similar results. Checkpoints are saved with versioning so one can roll back if needed.
* **Minimal Dependencies:** We avoided heavy frameworks and kept the dependency list short. Each library serves a clear purpose. This reduces the burden of environment management. For example, not relying on a huge stack of distributed training libraries or database systems keeps things straightforward. The project can be installed with a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` and doesn’t require complex external services.
* **Lightweight and Local-Friendly:** The entire pipeline is designed to run on one modest machine. We provide notes (and in-code comments) on how to adjust if resources are limited. This ensures that a researcher with just a laptop can still experiment with HealthCare-GPT. If more compute is available, the same code can scale up (for example, increasing model size or using multiple GPUs with minor modifications), but the baseline configuration is tuned for small-scale usage.
* **Testing and Validation:** We can include a few simple tests or assertions in the code (for example, after preprocessing, assert that the vocabulary contains the special "HighRisk"/"LowRisk" tokens, or during inference, check that the model output for a known test input matches expected output). These help catch integration issues early and give confidence that changes haven’t broken functionality.
* **Extensibility:** A junior engineer can extend this project to other tasks (for instance, predicting different labels from the CSV, or fine-tuning on a new dataset) by following the established pattern. The code’s simplicity (especially the training loop from nanoGPT) is intentionally educational, making it easier to learn how transformers are trained.

By adhering to these principles, HealthCare-GPT offers a maintainable, reproducible, and easy-to-deploy solution for leveraging language models on healthcare data. It balances complexity and simplicity: using advanced models and techniques (transformer fine-tuning, Docker deployment) but presenting them in a digestible way. This ensures that even those with limited ML or infrastructure experience can get the system up and running, trust its behavior, and modify it for their own needs.

Overall, HealthCare-GPT demonstrates a full lifecycle: from data to model to deployment, all within reach on a local PC – empowering users to experiment with AI in healthcare without requiring large-scale resources.
